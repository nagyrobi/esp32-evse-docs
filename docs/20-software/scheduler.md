# Scheduler

The scheduler runs **time-based automation** on the EVSE: at chosen hours of the
week it can enable or disable charging, take the station in or out of service,
or clamp the charging current to a fixed value. A typical use is charging only
during a cheap night tariff, or limiting current during the day.

Because every rule is keyed to the wall-clock time, the scheduler is only useful
once the device knows the correct time — either from [NTP](#time-and-ntp) or set
manually.

## How it works

Each rule (a *schedule*) pairs one **action** with a weekly pattern of **active
hours**. The scheduler re-evaluates all rules:

- about one second after boot,
- at the top of every hour,
- whenever the clock is set via [`POST /time`](rest-api.md#getpost-time),
- and on every successful NTP sync.

Evaluation is **edge-triggered** per rule. For each schedule the scheduler asks
"is the current hour active?" and compares the answer to the rule's previous
state:

- hour becomes active → the rule's **on** action fires once,
- hour becomes inactive → the rule's **off** action fires once.

Nothing fires again until the active/inactive state actually changes, so a rule
that stays active across several hours acts only at its start and end. After a
reboot every rule starts in an "unknown" state and is resolved on the first
evaluation, so the correct on/off action is applied for the current hour.

!!! note
    The hourly granularity is intentional — schedules act on whole hours, not
    minutes. A rule with hour 22 active turns on at 22:00 and (if 23 is
    inactive) off at 23:00.

## Actions

| Action | On (hour active) | Off (hour inactive) |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| `Enable charging` | Enable charging | Disable charging |
| `Charger available` | Put EVSE in service | Take EVSE out of service |
| `Charging current 6A` | Set charging current to **6 A** | Restore the default charging current |
| `Charging current 8A` | Set charging current to **8 A** | Restore the default charging current |
| `Charging current 10A` | Set charging current to **10 A** | Restore the default charging current |

!!! note
    The fixed-current actions cover only 6 / 8 / 10 A. For other values, drive the current other ways, like from a [Lua script](Lua.md) instead.

!!! warning
    Schedules do not coordinate with each other. If two rules touch the same
    thing in the same hour (for example two `Charging current *` rules, or `Enable` and
    `Available` with conflicting patterns), they are applied in array order and
    the later one wins for that hour — and an `off` edge on one rule can undo an
    `on` edge on another. Keep at most one rule per controlled quantity active at
    any given hour.

## The weekly hour pattern

Under the hood, each schedule carries seven values, one per weekday (`mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`,
`fri`, `sat`, `sun`). Each value is a **24-bit hour mask**: bit *h* (value
`2^h`) set means the action is active during hour *h*, where hour 0 is
00:00–01:00 and hour 23 is 23:00–24:00.

So a value is the sum of `2^h` for every active hour:

| Pattern | Active hours | Value |
| ------- | ------------ | ----- |
| Whole day | 0–23 | `16777215` (`0xFFFFFF`) |
| Nothing | — | `0` |
| Night 22:00–06:00 | 22, 23, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | `12582975` |
| Daytime 09:00–16:00 | 9–15 | `65024` |

Worked example for the night window: hours 0–5 contribute `2^0+…+2^5 = 63`, and
hours 22–23 contribute `2^22 + 2^23 = 12582912`; together `12582975`.

### Hour → bit value reference

| Hour | Value | Hour | Value | Hour | Value |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 0 | 1 | 8 | 256 | 16 | 65536 |
| 1 | 2 | 9 | 512 | 17 | 131072 |
| 2 | 4 | 10 | 1024 | 18 | 262144 |
| 3 | 8 | 11 | 2048 | 19 | 524288 |
| 4 | 16 | 12 | 4096 | 20 | 1048576 |
| 5 | 32 | 13 | 8192 | 21 | 2097152 |
| 6 | 64 | 14 | 16384 | 22 | 4194304 |
| 7 | 128 | 15 | 32768 | 23 | 8388608 |

Add the values for the hours you want active to get the weekday mask.

## Time and NTP

The scheduler reads the system clock in local time, so both the time source and
the timezone matter.

| Field | Notes |
| ----- | ----- |
| `Enabled` | Enable the SNTP client |
| `Server` | NTP server hostname |
| `Server From DHCP` | Also accept an NTP server offered by DHCP (refreshed on new IP) |
| `timezone` | IANA zone **name**, e.g. `Europe/Budapest` |

`timezone` is the zone *name*, not a POSIX `TZ` string — the firmware maps the

Setting the clock **without NTP**: send the Unix epoch seconds to
[`POST /time`](rest-api.md#getpost-time); this also re-evaluates all schedules
immediately. With NTP enabled, each sync re-evaluates them too.

!!! note
    Configuration (NTP settings, timezone and all schedules) is stored in NVS
    and survives reboots. After a power cycle the rules are restored and
    evaluated for the current hour as soon as the time is known.

## Configuring over REST

Read and write everything through one endpoint,
[`/config/scheduler`](rest-api.md#getpost-configscheduler). A `GET` returns the
current configuration; a `POST` replaces it (NTP/timezone plus the full
`schedules` array).

```json
{
  "ntpEnabled": true,
  "ntpServer": "pool.ntp.org",
  "ntpFromDhcp": false,
  "timezone": "Europe/Budapest",
  "schedules": [
    {
      "action": "enable",
      "mon": 12582975, "tue": 12582975, "wed": 12582975,
      "thu": 12582975, "fri": 12582975, "sat": 0, "sun": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

This single rule enables charging on weekday nights (22:00–06:00) and keeps it
disabled at all other times and on weekends.

```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.4.1/api/v1/config/scheduler \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data @scheduler.json
```

To remove all automation, send an empty `schedules` array.

## Examples

### Cheap-tariff night charging

Enable charging only between 22:00 and 06:00 every day:

```json
{
  "action": "enable",
  "mon": 12582975, "tue": 12582975, "wed": 12582975,
  "thu": 12582975, "fri": 12582975, "sat": 12582975, "sun": 12582975
}
```

### Reduced current during the day, full current at night

Two rules. The first clamps to 6 A during the day; outside those hours it
restores `defaultChargingCurrent`, which you would set to your full current.

```json
[
  {
    "action": "ch_cur_6a",
    "mon": 65024, "tue": 65024, "wed": 65024,
    "thu": 65024, "fri": 65024, "sat": 0, "sun": 0
  }
]
```

During 09:00–16:00 on weekdays the current is held at 6 A; at 16:00 it returns
to the configured default.

### Weekday-only availability

Keep the station out of service at weekends:

```json
{
  "action": "available",
  "mon": 16777215, "tue": 16777215, "wed": 16777215,
  "thu": 16777215, "fri": 16777215, "sat": 0, "sun": 0
}
```
