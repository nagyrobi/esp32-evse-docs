## Connection examples

L1 - L3 connections onboard charging voltage meter, they are optional. Use 30mA fuses to connect them to the lines.

CT1 - CT3 connections for current transformers measuring charging current, they are optional. Can be used any with ratio 2000/1 (for example: DL-CT08CL5 or SCT-013-000). 

If you don't want to have an onboard meter, set `Energy meter` `Mode` to `Dummy`, power will be calculated from actual charging current slider and the `AC voltage` value in the settings.

When you only have current transformers, set `Energy meter` `Mode` to `Current sensing`, power will be calculated from measured current and the `AC voltage` value in the settings.

When you have current transformers and voltages connected, set `Energy meter Mode` to `Current and voltage sensing`, power will be calculated from the real measured current and voltage.

Remember to check `Energy meter` checkbox `Three phases` in case your installation is relying on a three-phase connection.

`Residual Current Monitor` (RCM) is optional, if is not available it must be disabled in settings.

### With socket outlet

![Wiring socket outlet](/images/esp32s2da-wiring-lock.png)

Set `Max charging current` to the value of the circuit breaker that protects the EVSE.

### With fixed cable

![Wiring fixed cable](/images/esp32s2da-wiring-cable.png)

Set `Max charging current` to the lower value of the circuit breaker that protects the EVSE or cable maximum current.
