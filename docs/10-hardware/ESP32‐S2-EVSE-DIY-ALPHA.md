## Connection examples

L1 - L3 connection is for measuring charging voltage, they are optional. Use 100mA fuse to connect them to the lines.

CT1 - CT3 are current transformers for measuring charging current, they are optional. Can be used any which has ratio 2000/1 (for example: DL-CT08CL5 or SCT-013-000). 

When you have setup without current transformers and voltages connection set `Energy meter Mode` to `Dummy`, power will be calculated from actual charging current and provided `AC voltage`.

When you have only current transformers, can be set `Energy meter Mode` to `Current sensing`, power will be calculated from measured  current and provided `AC voltage`.

When you have current transformers and voltages connection, can be set `Energy meter Mode` to `Current and voltage sensing`, power will be calculated from measured current and voltage.

Remember set `Energy meter Three phases` depending on whether you have a single-phase or three-phase connection.

Residual Current Monitor (RCM) is optional, if is not available it must be disabled in settings.

### With socket outlet

![Wiring socket outlet](https://github.com/dzurikmiroslav/esp32-evse/wiki/images/esp32s2da-wiring-lock.png)

Set `Max charging current` to the value of the circuit breaker that protects the EVSE.

### With fixed cable

![Wiring fixed cable](https://github.com/dzurikmiroslav/esp32-evse/wiki/images/esp32s2da-wiring-cable.png)

Set `Max charging current` to the lower value of the circuit breaker that protects the EVSE or cable maximum current.

## Wallbox build example
