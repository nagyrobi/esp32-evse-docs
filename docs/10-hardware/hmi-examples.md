A couple of options to create Human-Machine Interface for ESP32-EVSE.

## Nextion

The Nextion API built into the firmware allows implementation of Nextion displays as HMI.

For an advanced example of HMI built with a Nextion display check out the [esp32-evse-nextion](https://github.com/dzurikmiroslav/esp32-evse-nextion) repository.

## ESPHome with LVGL

The AT commannds engine can be used to communicate from other open source projects like ESPHome with ESP32-EVSE. 

This example relies on the [external ESPHome component](https://github.com/nagyrobi/esp32evse-esphome) to integrate communication, and supports several display types. Check out the [esp32evse_esphome-lvgl](https://github.com/nagyrobi/esp32evse_esphome-lvgl) repository for details.

This can be used not only for graphical displays. One may implement [just a LED strip with a pixel animation to suggest charging state](https://github.com/nagyrobi/esp32evse_esphome-lvgl/blob/main/esp32-evse_ledstrip_for_twc2.yaml).
